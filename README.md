# wack script
A wack script for a wack map. This Geoguessr map actually: https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/63dd8b99bb79969aeb40fb3b

To install, click this link to install in Tampermonkey: [link](https://github.com/echandler/wack-script/raw/main/wackScript.user.js). If that doesn't work, open a new file in Tampermonkey and copy and past the wackScript.user.js file above in to it.


#### Do you want to create your own round?

Hallelujah, rounds for this map are hard to make, if you would lke to contribute your own wack round you will need at least four things:
- An idea. Harder than it sounds.
- An account on [map-maker.app](https://map-maker.app).
- The helper script: [link](https://github.com/echandler/wack-script/raw/main/wackHelperScript.user.js)
- And this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ce71eMwMvc

I'm not sure about the popularity of this map, so for now if you could message me on discord at "echandler#6868" with your round's JSON.


#### Do you want to use this script on your own map?

That's really easy, just copy the script and change appropriate variable to the name of your map and it should work immediately.
